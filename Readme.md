# 🧠 SAT Score Impact Analyzer

Welcome to the **SAT Score Impact Analyzer** project — a Python-based tool built to help students and educators understand **which questions have the greatest impact on SAT scores** using adaptive scoring logic.

This solution was developed as part of a take-home assignment for **HighScores.ai** to simulate "what-if" scenarios and provide **insightful feedback** on how students can maximize their score improvements.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Given:
- A student's SAT diagnostic attempt
- The SAT adaptive scoring rules (easy vs. hard modules)
- A raw-to-scaled score mapping

The goal is to:
1. **Analyze current scores** based on correct answers.
2. **Simulate what-if scenarios**: If a student corrected their mistakes, how much would their score improve?
3. **Identify top-impact questions** that would yield the highest gains if answered correctly.
4. **Highlight cascading effects** (e.g., unlocking a harder module to avoid scoring penalty).

## 🔍 Explanation of Results
- ✅ Current Scaled Score: Actual score the student received.

- ✅ Module 2 Type: Adaptive path ("easy" or "hard"). "Hard" gives better score scaling.

- ✅ What-if Fixes: Simulated scenario if a previously wrong answer was corrected.

- ✅ Gain: Points the student could gain by fixing that question.

- ✅ Module Flip: If correcting that question would have changed the module from easy → hard, unlocking a higher scoring potential.

---

## 🧠 Highlights
- Supports adaptive scoring logic used in SAT (section-based difficulty paths).

- Simulates cascading effects of getting module upgrade.

- Helps identify high-leverage questions for smarter preparation.

- Built with clean, readable Python (no unnecessary libraries).

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements (Optional Ideas)
- Add MongoDB support for scalable storage.

- Visual dashboards with Streamlit.

- Time-based scoring weight (longer questions = higher impact).

- Grouping of topics to suggest weak areas.
